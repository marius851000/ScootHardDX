up unless you work for Polygon. Just look around the place for
ways to destroy it.

,,Intermission Intro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to their importance in weather control
and other tasks, there's a certain bit of
nationalism and pride within the Pegasus
race, and thus within the Pegasi city of
Cloudsdale within Equestria. However,
something changed recently that made
that even more profound.",SHDX_INTRO_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pegasi across Equestria were
suddenly required to do fitness exams,
and if they failed, are incarcerated
at the Cloudsdale Weather Corporation.",SHDX_INTRO_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meet Scootaloo. She, her friend
Orion Solstice, and another pegasi by
the name of Aurora Dawn all failed
their exams. Scootaloo failed, despite
being trained by Rainbow Dash.",SHDX_INTRO_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo doesn't take this sitting down,
and causes a distraction and gets away.
A guard chases after her.

She wrestles with the guard in the
construction zone, before exerting
enough force to overpower him. The two
fall down a ventilation shaft thirty floors
to the surface - to the Cloudsdale
Weather Corporation's ground location.",SHDX_INTRO_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fortunately for Scootaloo, she
survived the fall. The guard was not so lucky.",SHDX_INTRO_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She finds a two way CB radio, utility belt
and a hoof blaster on the dead guard.
Surely someone out there could help her.
However, she can't get a signal from here.",SHDX_INTRO_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arming herself with the blaster and
strapping the utility belt up, she sees a door
ahead. Her goal is simple - survive and rescue
Orion, and Aurora if she can. There's no telling
what unspeakable nightmares she'll encounter.",SHDX_INTRO_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 1 End,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo takes a breather after enduring
a heated battle with Surprise and her
platoon of Rocket Guards. She can hardly
believe it herself.

She spots the exit behind Surprise's mosh
pit.",SHDX_EP1END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She climbs a radio tower and signals for
help. She manages to get ahold of someone,
but it's going to take a while for reinforcements
to arrive. Scootaloo is on her own.",SHDX_EP1END_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eventually she finds a computer room.
One of the screens lights up.

""Well, hello Scootaloo.""",SHDX_EP1END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The aqua green pony looked like a bastardized
version of Rainbow Dash. Scootaloo was
shocked and confused.

""Who are you?""

The rainbow maned pony didn't
acknowledge. ""Surrender now,
Scootaloo.""",SHDX_EP1END_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""There's nowhere to go. This factory
will be your grave.""",SHDX_EP1END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""I don't need to kill you yet... I can
kill one of your friends first. Doesn't
that sound fun?""

They let out a menacing laugh.",SHDX_EP1END_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo knew what she had to do.

She had to get them back for sure.

However, little did she know what
fears and horrors await her...",SHDX_EP1END_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 2 Intro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr. Atmosphere, the head engineer,
needed to act fast. Scootaloo was
approaching at a rapid clip. He asks
the rainbow-maned Pegasus for
advice.",SHDX_EP1INTRO_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They calmly contemplate for a
moment.

""Release the enforcers.""",SHDX_EP1INTRO_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr. Atmosphere was reluctant at
first. ""They're a wee bit unstable,
we need more time to test them.""

The multicolored Pegasus was
not having it. ""I don't care. Do it
now.""

Dr. Atmosphere chuckles a bit
and gives the Pegasus an odd
amulet. ""Okay then, but I'm
warning you...",SHDX_EP1INTRO_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The dictatorial Pegasus puts it on, and
lets out a scream of agonizing pain.",SHDX_EP1INTRO_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 2 End,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo takes the teleporter back to
the main facility after killing the deranged
Dr. Atmosphere. She sees a television
screen. It's the head pony - the one that
looks like Rainbow Dash. They've got Orion
Solstice over the gaping maw of a machine.",SHDX_EP2END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Scootaloo, you killed my top
engineer... you ruined me,
now I'll ruin you!""",SHDX_EP2END_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Orion looks at the screen.
""Don't worry Scoots, I love
you! Kick flank! Goodbye.""

Before she could say goodbye
back, Orion is dropped into the
device.",SHDX_EP2END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The machine spits out bright
components - mainly red. It's
pumped into a nightmarish
contraption.",SHDX_EP2END_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""You see Scoots, that's what
you get for crossing me. If you
don't surrender, it's going to
be Aurora next!""",SHDX_EP2END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo, trying not to cry
at the loss of her friend,
raises the CB radio and uses
it.

""Go buck yourself...""",SHDX_EP2END_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At this point, Scootaloo has one
goal in mind....

They must die for what they did
to Orion. And that machine must
be destroyed before it causes
even more death.

You go through a teleporter. It
takes you not to another part
of the facility, but to Cloudsdale's
outer reaches...",SHDX_EP2END_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Pre Maimbow Fight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow prepares to take on Scootaloo. In
his preoccupation, Aurora manages to slip
away and hide somewhere. Will Scootaloo
be able to save her, or will she meet a
terrible fate like Orion did?

Maimbow is armed to the teeth. And he
is not going to go down easily. It's do or die.",SHDX_EP3INTER_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 3 End (Shared),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo stands over the dying body
of Maimbow Undash. He drops the amulet,
as well as a rose colored contact lens. His
cutie mark wears off. It was painted over.

Scootaloo recognizes it. It was Lightning
Dust. She had disguised herself!

Scootaloo was in shock.",SHDX_EP3END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Why, Lightning Dust?""

""Because your big sister ruined
me! What better way than to ruin her
legacy? I wanted her to suffer...

So I worked my way up the Cloudsdale
Weather Corporation and hatched a plan...
to get back at not just her... but you as well!""",SHDX_EP3END_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo took a step back. She couldn't
believe it.

""You did all this just to get back at us?
Ponies have died because of you!""

Maimbow started to falter. ""I know... I let
hate overflow me... and for that, I have paid
the price.""",SHDX_EP3END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo stood in awe as Maimbow
laid in his own blood.

""See Scootaloo, I knew you wouldn't
pass those required exams... so I knew
you'd end up here. and I'd be able to
destroy you in that machine... and then
I could some day amass an army to take
down Rainbow Dash and tell her it was
all her fault!""

Maimbow chuckled. ""I was such a
fool. I let my hate blind me.""",SHDX_EP3END_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow faltered more as he lost
more blood. ""Forgive me... please...
whatever waits me beyond this,
I deserve and I am ready for.""",SHDX_EP3END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 3 End (Bad),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo contemplated for a moment.
She couldn't bear to think about all the pain
and misery Maimbow had brought her.
She lost two of her friends to this bastard.",SHDX_EP3AEND_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She had her answer.

""You know what, you're right. I'll forgive
you...""",SHDX_EP3AEND_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""..In hell.""",SHDX_EP3AEND_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow was thrown into the second
barely functional Pegasus Device, head
first. The machine puked out every
color known to Pegasuskind. Scootaloo
knew what she had to do.

The Pegaus race was too sick to save.
It was disgraced by the actions of the
Cloudsdale Weather Corporation.

It must be purged.",SHDX_EP3AEND_9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She got control of the Enforcers using Maimbow's
amulet. She also got control of the Spectrawasps.

She swore to exterminate every last
pegasi in Equestria and beyond,
starting with the remaining forces of the
Cloudsdale Weather Corporation. Those who
chose to surrender were lobotomized, and
forced to serve in her burning crusade.",SHDX_EP3AEND_10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The loss of Orion and Aurora had pushed
Scootaloo to insanity.

Once she's done with the Pegasus race, who
knows what horrific crimes she'll continue to
commit against life itself.

Scootaloo is no more, her soul is but a fleeting
memory, and her body an empty husk of her
former self. All that remains is Absentia.

Here she will continue her war against life itself...
In the Rainbow Factory... where not a single
soul gets through.",SHDX_EP3AEND_11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 3 End (Good),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aurora, who had been quiet, spoke up.
""Maimbow, I forgive you. I believe love can conquer
all evils in this world... if I were to let hate
consume me, I'd be no better than you.""",SHDX_EP3BEND_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo thought for a moment. She then
spoke up. ""Aurora's right. I must end the
cycle of hate somewhere. However, rest
assured, I'm going to help ensure this
never happens anywhere again. Got it?""",SHDX_EP3BEND_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow sheds a tear. ""Rainbow did
good.""",SHDX_EP3BEND_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He gasps his last breath, before his life slowly
fades from his body.",SHDX_EP3BEND_9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo sees the amulet that Maimbow
dropped. It has a weird symbol. It appears
to be what Maimbow used to control the
Enforcers. She breaks the amulet. She
hopes that frees them.",SHDX_EP3BEND_10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo, with a renewed sense of
purpose, looks at her new friend. The
two had survived the Cloudsdale
Weather Corporation.",SHDX_EP3BEND_11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""I'm Scootaloo."" She says to Aurora.

""I'm Aurora Dawn. Thanks for saving me.""

Scootaloo and Aurora made a promise
that day to each other... they'd remember
Orion, and never forget what happened here.

However, they also found it in their hearts
to forgive and learn from this. Equestria
would recover.",SHDX_EP3BEND_12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
