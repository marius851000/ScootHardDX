up unless you work for Polygon. Just look around the place for
ways to destroy it.

,,Intermission Intro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to their importance in controlling weather and other divine areas of expertise, there's a certain bit of nationalism within the Pegasus race. This is especially true within the proud city of Cloudsdale. However, something in the recent past changed that made this even more profound.",SHDX_INTRO_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pegasi across Equestria were suddenly required to do intensive fitness exams. If they failed, they were incarcerated at the Cloudsdale Weather Corporation.",SHDX_INTRO_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meet Scootaloo. Despite being trained by the exceptional Rainbow Dash, she failed her exams. Not only her, but her friends Orion Solstice and Aurora Dawn. The feds rolled in to cart them away, but Scootaloo didn't take that sitting down. She caused a distraction and escaped.",SHDX_INTRO_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A guard chased her down, so she had to wrestle him in the construction zone before overpowering him. The two fell down a ventilation shaft thirty floors to the surface - to the Cloudsdale Weather Corporation's ground location.",SHDX_INTRO_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fortunately for Scootaloo, she survived the fall. The guard was not so lucky.",SHDX_INTRO_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She found a two-way CB radio, a utility belt, and a hoof blaster on the dead guard. Surely she could use those to contact someone to help her. However, she couldn't get a signal from there.",SHDX_INTRO_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arming herself with the blaster and utility belt, she saw a door ahead of her. Her goal was simple: survive. rescue Orion and Aurora if she could. There was no telling what unspeakable nightmares she'd encounter.",SHDX_INTRO_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 1 End,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scootaloo took a breather after enduring the heated battle with Surprise and her platoon of Rocket Guards. She could hardly believe it herself. She spotted the exit behind Surprise's mosh pit.,SHDX_EP1END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She climbed a radio tower and signaled for help. She managed to get a hold of someone, but it was going to take a while for reinforcements to arrive. Scootaloo was on her own.",SHDX_EP1END_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eventually, she found a computer room. One of the screens lit up.

""Why, hello there Scootaloo.""",SHDX_EP1END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The aqua green pony looked like a bastardized version of Rainbow Dash. Scootaloo was shocked and confused.

""Who are you?""

The rainbow-maned pony didn't acknowledge.",SHDX_EP1END_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Surrender now, Scootaloo. There's nowhere to go. This factory will be your grave.",SHDX_EP1END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""I don't need to kill you yet... I can kill one of your friends first. Doesn't that sound fun?"" They let out a menacing laugh.",SHDX_EP1END_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scootaloo knew what she had to do. She had to get them back for sure. Little did she know what fears and horrors would await her...,SHDX_EP1END_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 2 Intro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr. Atmosphere, the head engineer, needed to act fast. Scootaloo was approaching at a rapid pace. He asked the rainbow-maned Pegasus for advice.",SHDX_EP2INTRO_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They calmly contemplated for a moment.

""Release the enforcers.""",SHDX_EP2INTRO_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr. Atmosphere was reluctant at first. ""They're a wee bit unstable; we need more time to test them.""

The multicolored Pegasus was not having it. ""I don't care. Do it now.""

Dr. Atmosphere chuckled a bit and gave the Pegasus an unusual-looking amulet. ""Okay then, but I'm warning you...""",SHDX_EP2INTRO_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The totalitarian Pegasus put it on, and let out a scream of agonizing pain.",SHDX_EP2INTRO_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 2 End,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scootaloo took the teleporter back to the main facility after killing the deranged Dr. Atmosphere. She saw a television screen there. On it was the head pony - the one that looked like Rainbow Dash. They had Orion Solstice over the gaping maw of a machine.,SHDX_EP2END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Scootaloo, you killed my top engineer... you ruined me; now I'll ruin you!""",SHDX_EP2END_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Orion looked at the screen. ""Don't worry, Scoots. I love you! Kick flank! Goodbye.""

Before she could say goodbye back, Orion was dropped into the device.",SHDX_EP2END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The machine spat out bright components - mainly red. All that was pumped into a nightmarish contraption.,SHDX_EP2END_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""You see, Scoots, that's what you get for crossing me. If you don't surrender, it's going to be Aurora next!""",SHDX_EP2END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo, trying not to cry at the loss of her friend, raised the CB radio to her mouth and used it.

""Go buck yourself...""",SHDX_EP2END_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At this point, Scootaloo had one goal in mind...

""They must die for what they did to Orion. And that machine must be destroyed before it causes even more death.""

Scootaloo went through a teleporter. It took her, not to another part of the facility, but to Cloudsdale's outer reaches...",SHDX_EP2END_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Secret Level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo found herself inside of a hellish landscape.

How she got here was a mystery, but one thing was certain...

This was no place for the living...",SHDX_INTROSECRETLEVEL_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Pre Maimbow Fight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow prepared to take on Scootaloo. In his preoccupation, Aurora managed to slip away and hide somewhere. Will Scootaloo be able to save her, or will she meet a terrible fate like Orion did?

Maimbow was armed to the teeth. And he was not going to go down easily. It was do or die.",SHDX_EP3INTER_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 3 End (Shared),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo stood over the dying body of Maimbow Undash. He dropped the amulet, as well as a rose colored contact lens. His cutie mark wore off. It was painted over.

Scootaloo recognized it. It was Lightning Dust. She had disguised herself!

Scootaloo was in shock.",SHDX_EP3END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Why, Lightning Dust?""

""Because your big sister ruined me! What better way than to ruin her legacy? I wanted her to suffer...

""So I worked my way up the Cloudsdale Weather Corporation ladder and hatched a plan… to get back at not just her... but you as well!""",SHDX_EP3END_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo took a step back. She couldn't believe it.

""You did all this just to get back at us? Ponies have died because of you!""

Maimbow started to falter. ""I know... I let hate overflow me... and for that, I have paid the price.""",SHDX_EP3END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo stood in awe as Maimbow laid in his own blood.

""You see, Scootaloo, I knew you wouldn't pass those required exams... so I knew you'd end up here. I'd be able to destroy you in that machine... and then I could some day amass an army to take down Rainbow Dash to tell her it was all her fault!""

Maimbow chuckled. ""I was such a fool. I let my hate blind me.""",SHDX_EP3END_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow faltered as he lost more blood. ""Forgive me... please… whatever awaits me beyond this, I deserve and am ready for.""",SHDX_EP3END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 3 End (Bad),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scootaloo contemplated for a moment. She couldn't bear to think about all the pain and misery Maimbow had brought her. She lost two of her friends to this bastard.,SHDX_EP3AEND_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She had her answer.

""You know what, you're right. I'll forgive you...""",SHDX_EP3AEND_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""..In hell.""",SHDX_EP3AEND_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow was thrown into the second barely functional Pegasus Device, head first. The machine puked out every color known to Pegasuskind. Scootaloo knew what she had to do.

The Pegasus race was too sick to save. It was disgraced by the actions of the Cloudsdale Weather Corporation.

It needed to be purged.",SHDX_EP3AEND_9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She got control of the Enforcers using Maimbow's amulet and later took control of the Spectrawasps.

She swore to exterminate every last pegasus in Equestria and beyond, starting with the remaining forces of the Cloudsdale Weather Corporation. Those  chose to surrender were lobotomized, and forced to serve in her burning crusade.",SHDX_EP3AEND_10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The loss of Orion and Aurora had pushed Scootaloo to insanity.

Once she was done with the Pegasus race, no one knew what horrific crimes she'd continue to commit against life itself for the remainder of her lifetime.

Scootaloo is no more. Her soul is but a fleeting memory, and her body an empty husk of her former self. All that remains is Absentia.

Here she will continue her war against life itself… In the Rainbow Factory... where not a single soul gets through.",SHDX_EP3AEND_11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Aurora, who had been quiet, spoke up. ""Maimbow, I forgive you. I believe love can conquer all evils in this world... If I were to let hate consume me, I'd be no better than you.""",SHDX_EP3BEND_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo thought for a moment. She then spoke up. ""Aurora's right. I must end the cycle of hate somewhere. However, rest assured, I'm going to help ensure this never happens anywhere again. Got it?""",SHDX_EP3BEND_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow shed a tear. ""Rainbow did good.""",SHDX_EP3BEND_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He gasped his last breath, before his life slowly faded from his body.",SHDX_EP3BEND_9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scootaloo saw the amulet that Maimbow dropped. It had a weird symbol on it. It appeared to be what Maimbow used to control the Enforcers. She broke it in hopes of freeing them.,SHDX_EP3BEND_10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo, with a renewed sense of purpose, looked at her friend. The two had survived the Cloudsdale Weather Corporation.

""Wow, we did it."" She said to Aurora.

""So, what now?"" asked Aurora.",SHDX_EP3BEND_11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo then asked, “Want to grab a bite to eat?”

“Sure” said Aurora, “I heard there’s this new barbecue restaurant that’s really good.”

Scootaloo and Aurora made a promise that day to each other: they'd remember Orion, and never forget what happened there.

However, they also found it in their hearts to forgive and learn from this. Equestria would recover.",SHDX_EP3BEND_12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
